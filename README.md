# SyncDemos

This is a repository I intend to dump any demo code or projects into, that I feel don't need their own repository. Right now there is only the ball collision demo, meant for Unity 2022 LTS.

Nothing here is meant to be production/shipping quality, but is simply meant to demonstrate concepts that people can use in their own projects.
